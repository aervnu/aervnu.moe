              It&apos;s me, Andy Nguyen. I live in Vietnam, last I checked I was 17. I make
              things that either break or are not of much use. Plus insane computers you probably wouldn&apos;t find in an average house.

              Regular expressions. I don&apos;t know why, but to me it&apos;s just really fun to
              craft and debug regex.

              Hardware virtualization and (some) low level stuff. I did learn a bit of
              x86 asm before but...you know what I mean. Not my priority either, since
              it has limited practicality in production environments.

              French and Japanese. Currently at DELF B1 for French, used to be at JLPT
              N5 for Japanese but I ended up not using it much. I still need a JLPT N2
              after I finish university, as I&apos;m aiming for a masters degree in Japan.
              <br/><br/>
              Networking. Lowkey my favorite when it comes to computing, even as
              traumatizing as it is setting up my Oracle VPS. Heading to a telecom
              corporation and aiming for a CCNA, but if need be I can attempt to get
              the CCNP.
              <br/><br/>
              Some web-oriented (idek if I got this right) languages, like
              C#, Java or JS. I have some experience with C# but haven&apos;t touched it
              for like...months? Anyway, it seems like they&apos;re what the market is
              targeting for now, so it kinda makes sense to learn them.
