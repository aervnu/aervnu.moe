Yes, my website. Please open a PR if you have any suggestions for it.

I'm still fairly new to this type of thing, and messy things are expected. I appreciate constructive feedback and contribution.

## Who helped make this?

Credits can be found [here](https://aervnu.moe/credits).

## Development

Requirements: Node.js â‰¥ 20. Use `pnpm` instead of `npm`, *please*. It's faster and you would have much fewer issues with packages.

Install dependencies:

`pnpm install --save-dev`

Start the site with real-time changes, served at `localhost:3000`:

`pnpm run dev`
